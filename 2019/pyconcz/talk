# Talking Python to Kubernetes

## Description (90-200 words)

These days Kubernetes is de facto norm in the containers world. There are many tools
already available to talk kubernetes from CLI to web UI. Yet, if you want to
write your own, the situation is not that simple. Mostly because the majority
of examples, and provided libraries are in Go, the language Kubernetes is written in.

During this presentation, Maciej will guide you through basic set of steps that
are necessary to write a simple application talking to any kubernetes cluster in
Python. Topics to be covered include:
- connecting to a cluster, including reading configuration files,
- using in-cluster configuration for an application running inside the cluster,
- setting up access right for your application,
- overview of the available API.

After this talk you will feel comfortable using Python to talk to any kubernetes
cluster. You will be armed with a set of simple examples showing all the aspects
covered during this presentation.


## Why you're the right person to talk about the topic (50-90 words)

I'm a passionate developer with over 10 years of experience in many languages.
Currently, I'm working for Red Hat, and for the past 4 years, I'm one of the
core contributors to Kubernetes and OpenShift. In Kubernetes I've been writing
everything starting from controllers, through API. Currently, I'm leading the
kubectl subproject, which is one of the main consumers of Kubernetes API.
At the same time, I'm using Python daily for my side projects, also I'm helping
CPython core developers maintaining bugs.python.org and working on IMAP built-in.
