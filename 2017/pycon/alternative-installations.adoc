## OpenShift Installations

This workshop requires having OpenShift cluster running. Here are the possible ways
you can get OpenShift:

. https://www.openshift.com/[OpenShift Online] - which gives you access to 1GiB
  of storage and memory.
. https://www.openshift.org/minishift/[Minishift] - which runs a single-node
  OpenShift cluster in a pre-configured VM.
. https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/docs/cluster_up_down.md[oc cluster up] -
  which sets up a local all-in-one cluster using docker containers.
