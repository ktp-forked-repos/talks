## Video and Image Back ends

So far we have deployed the front end and text backed. We feed text database with
data periodically. The last remaining bit, or rather two of them are the video
and image back ends.

### Templates

link:https://docs.openshift.org/latest/dev_guide/templates.html[Template] is a
list of resources that you may create in OpenShift. The reason it stands out from
a plain list of objects is the fact that they can additionally contain parameters.
These parameters can be then either specified manually upon template instantiation,
or auto-generated by the system.

Let's check a link:https://github.com/soltysh/blast/tree/master/video/template.yaml[sample parameter definition]:

[source,yaml]
----
...
      MONGODB_USER: "${MONGODB_USER}"
      MONGODB_PASSWORD: "${MONGODB_PASSWORD}"
...
parameters:
  - name: MONGODB_USER
    description: mongodb database username
    generate: expression
    from: "[A-Za-z0-9]{24}"
    required: true
----

The upper part of the listing shows how to use parameters inside a Template. The
lower part defines a parameter, where:

- `name` - is the parameter name, that is used in the upper part of the Template.
- `description` - is being used in the web console to provide short information
  about given parameter.
- `generate` - the name of the generator to use, when empty no generation will happen.
- `from` - input value for the generator. The syntax is very similar to the one
  known from regular expressions.
- `required` - specifies this value is required and a Template cannot be instantiated
  without this value.

If you check the sources of link:https://github.com/soltysh/blast/[our sample application],
each of the subdirectories contains a file named `template.yaml`, which holds the
entire configuration necessary to build and deploy each of them on any cluster.
All you need to is find a cluster and run:

[source,bash]
----
oc new-app https://raw.githubusercontent.com/soltysh/blast/master/video/template.yaml
oc new-app https://raw.githubusercontent.com/soltysh/blast/master/image/template.yaml
----

which will result in creating all the resources we have previously created manually.
