# Writing kube controllers for everyone

## Description

With the introduction of Custom Resource Definition, as well as external API servers
everyone is now able to create its own resources and store them inside kubernetes
cluster.  But that is only half of the work that needs to be done. During this
presentation Maciej, who co-authored both Job and CronJob controllers, and is
a frequent reviewer of controller and apiserver-related code will guide you
through basic set of steps that are necessary to write a simple controller.
As an example he will discuss his recent work around improving CronJob controller,
as well as introduce the 11 rules that needs to be fulfilled when writing
a good controller.

Topics to be covered include:

1. How controllers work, loop over:
  * monitor resources
  * react to changes
2. Shared Informers.
3. Owner references.
4. Emitting status.
5. Handling errors.


## Benefits to the Ecosystem

Development documentation [1] contains a description how to write a controller, which even
contains a rough sketch of the code, but that's not always sufficient. Looking at already
written controllers might help, but since they are heavily worked on, they contain a lot
of additional code that is making them hard to follow. In this presentation I am hoping
to address the initial questions when writing first controller. I am going to show a simple
controller for a custom resource, and explain in details the 11 rules of controllers mentioned
in [1]. The code will be available freely available on github for further reference.
I'm hoping to close the presentation with an even more advanced use case.
