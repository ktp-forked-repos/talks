# The new life of bugs.python.org

## Description

Bugs.python.org (later called BPO) is the bug tracker supporting development
of CPython, the main implementation of Python language. During PyCon US in Portland,
Oregon, Maciej was asked to help migrate the current BPO instance into a new infrastructure.
His personal recommendation was to migrate BPO onto OpenShift/Kubernetes, especially
that it supports open source projects providing resources for running necessary
infrastructure bits.  This presentation will be the story how he migrated the legacy
BPO installation:

1. What is bugs.python.org
  * What it is and how it's being used?
  * Current deployment details.
1. Pick up the pieces
1. Build
  * Custom builder
    * Non-git repositories
  * Build process
1. Deployment
  * Database
  * Configuration
  * Deployment
1. Tips & tricks
1. Q&A


## Benefits to the Ecosystem

This talk is targeted at developers and operations interested in migrating their
legacy application to Kubernetes. Attendees leaving the room will learn how to leverage
containers, combined with 21st century cluster management, for creating fully automated
CI/CD flow for deploying any legacy application.
