# Audit in Kubernetes, the future is here

## Description

Last year during KubeCon EU Maciej talked about the need to improve the auditing
mechanism in Kubernetes, one year later the goal was reached. Stefan and Maciej
are core team members responsible for improving the aforementioned mechanism.
This presentation will outline the current possibilities of the audit mechanism.
How to adapt it to your own institutional and performance requirements and to
integrate it with your infrastructure.

Topics to be covered include:
1. From basic audit to advanced audit
2. Defining a policy
   * Example 1: Deep object logging
   * Example 2: Excluding secrets
   * Example 3: Logging different objects at different levels
3. Integrating with your infrastructure
4.  Performance impact vs. consistency
5. Writing an audit webhook server
6. Which future improvements are planned


## Benefits to the Ecosystem

This presentation is a gentle introduction to the audit subsystem in Kubernetes.
We are hoping to demystify the complexity of the policy configuration by showing
a handful of example rules that will allow attendees to better understand the mechanism.
For admins, we will discuss both the configuration part of the audit (how to write rules
and manage backends), as well as discuss its overall impact on the cluster performance.
For 3rdparties, we show how an audit webhook server can be built to consume the audit
events to inject them into external systems.We will close the presentation discussing
planned enhancements to the mechanism.
