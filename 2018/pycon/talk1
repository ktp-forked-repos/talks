# The new life of bugs.python.org

## Description

[bugs.python.org](https://bugs.python.org/) (later called BPO) is the bug tracker
supporting the development of CPython, the main implementation of the Python language.
During PyCon US 2017 in Portland, OR, I was asked to help migrate the current instance to
a new infrastructure.
The decision was to use something new, which will be reliable yet easy to use and requiring
not much human attention.  We have decided to go with containers and Kubernetes, as the
current industry standard for managing them.
This presentation will be the war story of how I migrated a legacy application to OpenShift.
The story will cover two important topics:
1. python application - BPO runs [roundup](http://roundup.sourceforge.net/) with a few
additional tweaks.
2. PostgreSQL database holding all of the BPO's data.
Of the above two, none was working on containers out of the box before I started.


## Audience

Developers and operations interested in migrating their legacy application to
OpenShift/Kuberentes. Attendees leaving the room will learn how to leverage containers
for creating a fully automated CI/CD flow for deploying any legacy application.
