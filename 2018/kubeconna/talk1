# Audit in Kubernetes, the future is here

Advanced Auditing is now available, and you should learn how to use it. Last year,
we proposed a list of improvements to Kubernetes auditing, and this year we are
happy to report that we have delivered them! Join us for this session to learn
what Advanced Auditing does, how to adapt it to your own requirements, and how
to integrate it into your infrastructure.

Topics to be covered include:
1. From basic audit to advanced audit
2. Defining a policy (examples)
   * Deep object logging
   * Excluding secrets
   * Logging different objects at different levels
3. Integrating with your infrastructure
4. Performance impact vs. consistency
5. Writing an audit webhook server
6. Which future improvements are planned

We are hoping to demystify the complexity of the policy configuration by showing
a handful of example rules that will allow attendees to better understand the
mechanism.

For admins, we will discuss both the configuration part of the audit (how to write
rules and manage backends), as well as discuss its overall impact on the cluster
performance. For third party applications, we show how an audit webhook server
can be built to consume the audit events to inject them into external systems.
We will close the presentation discussing planned enhancements to the mechanism.


# Relevance for the ecosystem

Enterprise users expect an exhaustive auditing mechanism to comply with demanding
regulations. Kubernetes delivers this now, and allows the admin to customize
the balance between performance impact and consistency for the environment at hand.
This will become a standard step in every enterprise Kubernetes deployment in the future.
