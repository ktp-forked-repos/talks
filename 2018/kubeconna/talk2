# Writing kube controllers for everyone

So you have written your own Custom Resource Definition, and deployed it to your
Kubernetes cluster. Now what? Are you done? Not really; it is time for you to look
at custom controllers. This talk will explain how.
During this presentation Maciej, will guide you through basic set of steps that
are necessary to write a simple controller. As an example he will discuss his
recent work around improving CronJob controller, as well as introduce the 11 rules
that needs to be fulfilled when writing a good controller.

Topics to be covered include:

1. How controllers work, loop over:
  * monitor resources
  * react to changes
2. Shared Informers
3. Owner references
4. Emitting status
5. Handling errors


# Relevance for the ecosystem

Development documentation describes how to write a controller, and looking at
existing controllers helps, but neither is sufficient to get you started. In this
presentation I am going to address the initial questions when writing first controller.
