# The new life of bugs.python.org

## Description

Bugs.python.org (later called BPO) is the bug tracker supporting development
of CPython, the main implementation of Python language. During PyCon US in Portland,
OR I was asked to help migrate the current BPO instance into a new infrastructure.
My personal recommendation was to migrate BPO onto OpenShift Online, especially
that it supports open source projects providing resources for running necessary
infrastructure bits.  This presentation will be the story how I migrate legacy
BPO installation onto latest OpenShift.


## Audience

Developers and operations interested in migrating their legacy application onto
OpenShift or Kubernetes.


## Objective

Attendees leaving the room will learn how to leverage containers, combined with
21st century cluster management, hidden in, the latest version of OpenShift, for
creating fully automated CI/CD flow for deploying any legacy application.
